#### About

Summarize your time spent at the office based on Google's location history data.

The app generates daily and monthly summaries of your time spent
at the location you have marked as "Work" in Google Maps.
You can download the summary and use it, for example, to help fill your timesheet.


#### Usage

Upload your location history in JSON format in a zip file
generated by Google Takeout (https://takeout.google.com/).

To keep file size down, make sure to only include your location history in the Takeout.
