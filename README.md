# A Shiny app to track time spent at work

Summarize your time spent at work based on your location history data that Google collects.

Just how much time _do_ you spend at the office?
This app lets you find out with daily and monthly summaries of your time spent at
[the place you have marked as "Work"](https://support.google.com/maps/answer/3093979)
in Google Maps. You can download the summary and use it,
for example, to help you fill your timesheet.

## Usage

Export your location history in JSON format using Google Takeout (https://takeout.google.com/), and upload the generated zip file.

To keep file size down, make sure to only include your location history in the Takeout.
